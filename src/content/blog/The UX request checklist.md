### New task

- [ ] Is the request clear, have we fully diagnosed the problem?
- [ ] Have we validated the use case, do we really need to do this?
- [ ] Have I documented where this is coming from
- [ ] Do I have all the information, links, resources I need to complete this task?
- [ ] Have I managed expectations on timeline and capacity?

### Project

- [ ] Who are the stakeholders? What are their personalities?
- [ ] Whatâ€™s the overall timeline?
- [ ] Where are the priorities?
